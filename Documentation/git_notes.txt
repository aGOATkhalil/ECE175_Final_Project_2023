Many changes were made to this repo today with the help of Manny.
The problem was that working on the source code on another OS created a problem where I could not open the code and push anything to the repo.
Instead, the error was "Cannot open file [path]" and that was that. 

Solving the issue required adding .sln, .filters, and another file to .gitignore. Essentially we are telling the repo to ignore any changes to these file types
in order to focus on the source code.

To push changes made in Xcode, run the following commands in your terminal in the appropriate directory:

  % git add 
  % git commit -m "changed main.c"
  % git push


I will see the behavior from Windows when I get home.
